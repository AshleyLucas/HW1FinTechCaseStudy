# HW 1 FinTech Case Study
## Robo Advisory App & Financial Literacy for Women: Ellevest
* Incorporated 2014
* Founded by Sallie Krawcheck & Charlie Kroll
* Company was originally founded as a longterm investment planner to help women plan ahead for retirement and to support financial education/ coaching due to women having less pay in the workplace compared to men.
* The company has $92 million in funding as of 2021 and many of the funds are used from Vanguard, a leader in low cost ETFs
## Business Activities
* Target problem that company is addressing is helping women become more financially literate in a safe space with support from financial coaches and education on investing.
* The solutions offered by Ellevest differ in comparison to competitors by targeting specifically a younger demographic specificlly women whereas other companies, such as Betterment focus on general public. Ellevest's focus is primarily on achieving financial goals rather than beating market indexes
* Ellevest uses machine learning algorithims to guide customers through an automated investment advisory process and limit human intervention. Similar to traditional financial advisors, robo-advisors allocate a client's assets based on risk tolerance and target returns. Other technologies the company uses include; NGINX, Cloudfare, Ruby, Rails, and Google Analytics, to name a few.
## Landscapes
* Ellevest is in the Robo-Advisory domain of the financial industry
* Major trends that have come about in the past 5-10 years for this domain have been primarily in helping with a client's portfolio and growing wealth based on market index, whereas this platform differs by focusing on Women and achieving personal financial goals
* Other major companies in this domain include Betterment, Wealthfront, SoFi, and Vanguard
## Results
* The business impact as result has been to help women invest intentionally. The investment portfolios that Ellevest assists creating include supporting companies that have more women leaders and policies that advance women, Community development- invest in funds supporting loans for affordable housing and community services and Sustainable Practices-invest in companies with higher standards for sustainability and ethical practices.
* Some core metrics used to measure success for Robo-advisory services include; Account setup, Goal setting, Account Services, Portfolio Construction, Portfolio Management, User experience, Customer Service, Education & Security, & Fees. 
* In comparison to other companies Ellevest is performing quite well based on the above metrics due to its niche. Due to having a la carte financial professionals, a tier based memeber subscription, online seminars for education and no fees. 
## Recommendations 
* As a recommendation to Ellevest for improving their current processes, I suggest a personal advisor as part of the tier subscription rather than newly assigned advisors every time per chat window. This will simulate the experience of a traditional financial advisory service and help establish trust between the user and improve on customer experience having "their person" through the app.
